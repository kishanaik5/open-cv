1. Perform basic image handling and processing operations on the image and Display of gray scale images

2. Segmentation using watershed transform

3. Geometric transformation

4. Compute homography matrix

5. Perspective transformation

6. Camera caliberation

7. Compute fundamental matrix

8. SIFT feature descriptor

9. Extract SIFT features from an image and visualize keypoints on the original image. Discuss how SIFT can be used for matching between different images.

10. Compare the SURF and HOG feature descriptors by extracting features from the same image. Visualize and discuss the differences in keypoints and feature representation.

11. Implement a region counting algorithm to count the number of distinct regions in a segmented image. Display the original image with the regions labeled by their count.

12. Convert an image from RGB to different color spaces (e.g., HSV, LAB, YCbCr). Display the original image and each converted image side by side, explaining the significance of each color space.

13. Apply a Gaussian filter to an image to reduce noise. Display the original and filtered images side by side for comparison.

14. Combine two overlapping images into a single panoramic image. Display the original images and the final stitched panorama.
